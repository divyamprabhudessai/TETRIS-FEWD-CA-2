# TETRIS-FEWD-CA-2
Tetris is a classic puzzle game that involves arranging falling blocks into complete lines to clear them. Here are the basic instructions for playing Tetris:

Objective: The goal of Tetris is to score points by clearing lines of blocks. As the blocks fall from the top of the screen, your objective is to arrange them in a way that they form complete horizontal lines.

CONTROLS:

-> Move Left/Right: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the falling block left or right on the screen.
      
-> Rotate Block: Use the "W" or up arrow key to rotate the falling block. This allows you to fit the blocks together more efficiently.
        
-> Drop: Use the down arrow key to make the block drop.

SCORE:
On clearing a single line 10 points will be incremented to your score.

GAME OVER:
The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen, and there's no more room for new blocks to fall. The game over screen will then appear, displaying your score
